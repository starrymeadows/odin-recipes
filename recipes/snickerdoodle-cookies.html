    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Do you love cookies that are basically just butter rolled in sugar? When you eat cookie dough, do you want a single note: Just Butter? These are the cookies for you!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Unsalted Butter (softened)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Sugar</li>
        <li>2 large Eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Vanilla</li>
        <li>2 ¾ cup Flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoon Cream of Tartar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cinnamon-Sugar Mixture</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup Sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ Tablespoons Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined. 
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.</li>
        <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.</li>
