This is the first project for The Odin Project's Foundations path.

This project seeks to demonstrate basic knowledge of basic HTML: namely, the use of HTML boilerplate and various elements (such as head, body, hyperlinks, and images). It does this through the construction of a webpage detailing several recipes.
